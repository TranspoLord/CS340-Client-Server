# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
My programs have usually been built with modularity in mind. When I was in my Game Design courses,
I would always build the scripts with the mindset they could be adapted for other uses. I still
do this today with my coding files. It may come down to copy and pasting, but the code could still
then be used for other purposes. Like the python module that is used in tandom with the dashboard 
assignment. It can be adapted to be used with many other applications. 

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist
This is different on many levels mainly because of my ADHD. It wants to start at many different
locations, jump back and forth, and not complete anything. However, I've always been able to start
problems and finish them methodically. My approach for this project wasn't different, comparing other
projected I've worked on. For future database requests, I would always start with the basic CRUD
module to simply talk to the database. Then, once that's working, I'd start adding more
functionality, testing as it goes along.

# What do computer scientists do?
They do a lot of things. The world we know today wouldn't exist, not in the slightest, without
computer scientists. Phones, TVs, computers, GitHub, and even this README file wouldn't
exist without computer scientists. I was just at a convention and all the tools and hardware they
used wouldn't exist without these people. Computer scientists develop code, applications, and tools
for people to use to help create better things. These tools help companies do their work more 
efficiently and faster. For example, the convention I stated sponsered an animal shelter. Tools
developed by computer scientists allowed the convention to donate a larger sum of money as the
tools made it easier to track and donate.
